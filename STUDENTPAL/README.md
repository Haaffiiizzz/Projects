I have no idea yet what exactly I am trying to do or how exactly to go about it. I will just pour out my thoughts here. If by some miracle, I can get this done,
I feel it will be a relief to students. I know how much I've had to struggle with forgetting dealines or being overwhelmed with work I have to do.

I plan on creating an app that students can use to effectively track how much work they need to do, what deadlines they have. You would link the app to your 
schools portals like the eclass for UofA. It could have features that can rank the tasks in order of due dates, or grade weight or even both somehow. 
From this app, you get links directly to the tasks, maybe even upload your assignments directly from the app. Maybe even access to your professors slides directly,
it could have features that let you take notes, keep track of yor learning progess, set learning goals, maybe share resources with other users from the same institution.

It sounds really crazy in my head but who knows, I might make it work out. I will take my time with this, slowly learning every concept I'll need, practicing them on other little
projects. My goal to make atleast a working version of this is 6 months - 1 year. So help me God.

A wise man once told me "The only boundaries are your imagination and laziness".
